  # The app is signed ad-hoc (not notarized yet). Homebrew quarantines downloads
  # and no longer supports --no-quarantine, so clear the quarantine after install
  # to let the app launch without a Gatekeeper "damaged" warning.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Charge limiting, Low Power Mode, and sleep controls need a small root helper
    (a LaunchDaemon). After first launch, open the Battlify menu-bar item and
    click "Install Helper" — you will be asked for your password once. The helper
    re-enables charging automatically if it ever stops.
